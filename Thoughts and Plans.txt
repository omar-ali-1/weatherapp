Numbers need to be verified manually in Twilio API for sms to work, since it is in trial

Make settings in User entity booleans instead of strings
Use projections, or partial entity fetch, instead of fetching entire entity
Use task lets where appropriate.


A few things I didn't do in the interest of time:
Build project in isolated virtual env and add only libraries needed
Follow git commit best practices
I did not explicitly use caching, we can rely on AppEngine's automatic caching for now.
Use Google's key management service instead of datastore for added security
Use celery for task scheduling instead of A Trigger API for added security, control, robustness, and less cost
I tested these manually in production and development, but I would write tests that interact with the live application, testing features such as entity creation, deletion, modification, whether notifications are sent/received, whether endpoints return correct values, etc.
